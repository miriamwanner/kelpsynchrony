Hi All,

I have attached the new kelp data. 

Kelp_Bio is the summed biomass for each site in wet kg.
Kelp_Area is the summed area continuing kelp canopy in m2.
Kelp_Dens is the mean biomass across all pixels containing kelp canopy in kg/m2.

There are also Paddle versions of each, with the sites organized if you were to paddle down the coast from N to S. The paddle site coords are also included, and the third column shows the location of the site vs. the original site list.

I have not filled in any NaNs in any of these datasets.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
